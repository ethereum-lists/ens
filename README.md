# Background

This is a project which emerged from the ashes of [MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists) after the split of MyEtherWallet and MyCrypto. For some more context see [this issue](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/ethereum-lists/issues/432).

## ENS Lightlist

*Not currently used for anything meaningful but figured it'll be needed eventually.*
